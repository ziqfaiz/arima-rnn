If you do not have the book yet, make sure to grab a copy [here](https://www.manning.com/books/time-series-forecasting-in-python-book?utm_source=marcopeix&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_peixeiro_time_10_21_21&a_aid=marcopeix&a_bid=8db7704f)

In this book, you learn how to build predictive models for time series. Both the statistical and deep learnings techniques are covered, and the book is 100% in Python!

Specifically, you will learn how to:
- Recognize a time series forecasting problem and build a performant predictive model
- Create univariate forecasting models that accound for seasonality and external variables
- Build multivariate forecasting models to predict many time series at once
- Leverage large datasets using deep learning models for forecasting (implementation in TensorFlow/Keras)
- Automate the forecasting process

Plus, the book comes with a ton of hands-on projects with real-life data, such as the earnings per share of Johnson & Johnson, the daily stock price of Google, the US macroeconomic data, the volume of antidiabetic drug prescription in Australia, and much more.

 ## How to use this repo
 I highly recommend that you read the book and code along. This is the best way to take the most out of the book.

 Each folder corresponds to a chapter. They each contain the notebook with all the code presented in that chapter. The code is in order of appearance in the book. When appropriate, there is also a data folder cointaining the CSV file used in that chapter.

 ## State of progress
 Keep in mind that changes might be done anytime before the final release.
